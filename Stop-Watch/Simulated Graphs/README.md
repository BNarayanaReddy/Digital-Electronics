# Stopwatch Implementation - Simulation Results


I have included the simulation results for the Stopwatch implementation using the Mealy FSM model. The Stopwatch design was developed in Xilinx, a widely-used Electronic Design Automation (EDA) tool for FPGA and VLSI design.

## Mealy FSM Model

The Mealy FSM model is a type of finite state machine where the output is determined by both the current state and the input. This model is particularly useful for designing sequential circuits like the Stopwatch, where the output (display) depends on the current state (running, paused, reset) and the input (start, stop, reset).

## Simulation Results

The simulation results include waveform screenshots that visually represent the behavior of the Stopwatch design under various input conditions. These waveforms depict the changes in the output display and the transitions between different states of the FSM as the inputs (start, stop, reset) are applied.

The simulation process is a crucial step in the VLSI design flow, allowing for verification of the design's functionality before physical implementation. By simulating the design and analyzing the waveforms, potential issues or discrepancies can be identified and addressed early in the development cycle, saving time and resources.

## Next Steps

With the successful simulation of the Stopwatch design, the next step would be to synthesize the design for the target FPGA device and proceed with further steps in the implementation flow, such as:

- Place and route
- Bitstream generation
- On-chip debugging

## Significance

These simulation results demonstrate the practical application of FSM concepts and the design flow using Xilinx tools for implementing digital circuits like the Stopwatch on FPGAs or ASICs.
